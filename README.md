This changes not only who authored the commit but the listed commiter as well. It also is something I wrote as a joke, so please don't run this against your production repo and complain if this script deletes everything.

*Linus Torvalds didn't really approve of this. It's a joke to prove it works. [See his fake commit here](https://github.com/babakgh/git-blame-dima/commit/e5cfe4bb2190a2ae406d5f0b8f49c32ac0f01cd7)
